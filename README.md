# Description

**BiffleBall** is a **Survivor-Pool** style competition designed and created specifically for Baseball. Although we love the sport, Baseball being 162 games over 5 months makes it hard for the average fan to stay invested, especially if their team is out of it by mid-summer. **BiffleBall** provides a way for fans of the game to stay connected and always have a rooting interest regardless of individual team success.

# How to Play

Each week **(Monday-Sunday)** you select a team and get 1 point for every win that team has during the week. You can only use a team once per season (no repeats) and overall win % or total losses have no bearings on your final score. All wins are worth 1 point regardless of innings played, strength of team, etc, and whichever user has the most total wins after the season wins the coveted **BiffleBall Belt**.
